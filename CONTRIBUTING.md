## Coding Standards

### Dart Code Style

We follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). Key points:

- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Follow naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables, functions, and parameters
  - `PascalCase` for classes, enums, typedefs
  - `snake_case` for package names, file names
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs

### File Organization

```
iforevents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iforevents.dart          # Main export file
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                  # Data models
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/             # Integration interfaces
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                   # Utility classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/                        # Unit tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ example/                     # Example app
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.yaml
```

### Code Quality

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately
- Follow the single responsibility principle

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/specific_test.dart
```

### Test Structure

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:iforevents/iforevents.dart';

void main() {
  group('Iforevents', () {
    late Iforevents iforevents;

    setUp(() {
      iforevents = const Iforevents();
    });

    test('should initialize successfully', () async {
      // Test implementation
    });

    group('track method', () {
      test('should track events correctly', () {
        // Test implementation
      });
    });
  });
}
```

## Documentation

### API Documentation

- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Follow [effective Dart documentation guidelines](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation)
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions

### Example Documentation

```dart
/// Tracks an event with optional properties.
///
/// [eventName] is required and should be a descriptive name for the event.
/// [eventType] defaults to [EventType.track] if not specified.
/// [properties] contains additional data associated with the event.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// iforevents.track(
///   eventName: 'button_clicked',
///   properties: {'button_name': 'signup'},
/// );
/// ```
void track({
  required String eventName,
  EventType eventType = EventType.track,
  Map<String, dynamic> properties = const {},
}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - stable, production-ready code
- `develop` - integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name` - individual feature branches
- `hotfix/fix-name` - urgent fixes

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

Types:
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `style`: formatting changes
- `refactor`: code refactoring
- `test`: adding tests
- `chore`: maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(core): add automatic IP detection
fix(firebase): resolve initialization timing issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Integration Development

### Adding New Integrations

When adding a new analytics integration:

1. Create a new package following the naming convention `iforevents_[platform]`
2. Implement the `Integration` abstract class
3. Follow the existing integration patterns
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Update documentation
6. Add example usage

### Integration Structure

```dart
import 'package:iforevents/models/integration.dart';

class YourIntegration extends Integration {
  const YourIntegration({required this.apiKey});

  final String apiKey;

  @override
  Future<void> init() async {
    // Initialize your analytics platform
  }

  @override
  Future<void> identify({
    required String id,
    required Map<String, dynamic> data,
  }) async {
    // Identify user with your platform
  }

  @override
  Future<void> track({
    required String eventName,
    EventType eventType = EventType.track,
    Map<String, dynamic> properties = const {},
  }) async {
    // Track event with your platform
  }

  @override
  Future<void> reset() async {
    // Reset user data
  }
}
```

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers. The process includes:

1. Version bump in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Create a git tag
4. Publish to pub.dev
5. Create GitHub release
