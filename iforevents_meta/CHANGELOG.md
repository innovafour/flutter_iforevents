## 0.1.0

### 💥 Breaking

* **Requires `iforevents` ^0.1.0.** The previous `^0.0.5` constraint could not
  resolve against the current core, so this package silently held users back on
  the old core that still carried a project secret. Upgrade both together.

### 🐛 Fixes

* **`Order Completed` no longer crashes on a non-double total.** `total_amount`
  arrives untyped from the caller, so an `int` or a numeric `String` threw a
  cast error inside `logPurchase`. It is coerced now.
* **Screen views now reach Meta.** `pageView` was never overridden.
* `onPageView` is accepted by the constructor and forwarded to the caller.

## 0.0.3

**Multi-Platform Support** 🌐

### ✨ Improvements

* **Complete Platform Coverage**: Added support for Web, macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms
* **Enhanced Compatibility**: Updated to work with IForEvents 0.0.3 multi-platform support
